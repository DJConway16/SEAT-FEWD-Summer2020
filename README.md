# SEAT / FrontEnd Web Development

### Core Focus
This course will focus on the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We will be using some of the same tools that developers use in their day-to-day workflow such as Visual Studio Code and Git.

### Getting started

We begin this course with the creation of [Github][1] accounts. Github is a cloud environment and will serve as our main storage for our coding projects.

[1]: https://www.github.com

Later in the course we will discuss how to use Github as a version control system. This will allow us to take _snapshots_ of our projects that we can later access a previous version of our project. It is similar to saving a word processing document, but with historical content attached to those save points. We will discuss this more in depth throughout the course.

Just like we can use our social media and email accounts to login to other sites, we can use our Github accounts to login into many resourceful websites such as [Codepen](https://codepen.io/), [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) and [Codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/). In the first few days of class we will use [Codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/) as our primary development environment.

Although Codesandbox was built on top of Visual Studio Code, sometimes Visual Studio Code can be a little too helpful while were coding, i.e.: closing html tags automatically appear when closing the opening tag, helpful tooltips appear when hovering on nearly everything in your code and becuase it’s loaded with keyboard shortcuts, we may accidentally discover one while were coding causing us to get momentarily distracted in our workflow. Codesandbox minimizes these distractions by stripping away a lot of Visual Studio Code’s helpful features, allowing us to focus learning to code so that we can easily transition to VS Code later.
